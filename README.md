Wine Menu

In Wine Menu, I am trying to create a program that reads from an existing file, menu.txt, and displays to the user what wine
is available and for what course. The menu.txt file exists because the wine selection will change daily and the client should
be able to change what kind of wine is at hand. 

Part 1: 
The first three lines that are on the text file have specific designations. The first line is for dinner, second line is for dessert,
and the third line is for appetizers. After the 3rd line the meal course will repeat itself for example-

Lines 1, 4, 7 are reserved for dinner//
Lines 2, 5, 8 are reserved for dessert//
Lines 3, 6, 9 are for appetizers

Part 2:
Now that each line is placed into a parent class, the meal course, I need to divide the types of wines further. I need to be able to
classify each wine by its: year, region, and iced. 'Year' and 'region' will be represented by a String, meanwhile 'iced' will be a 
integer, "0" or "1", meaning yes or no.


**PS: I do not know a lot about wine
